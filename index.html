  <p>Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <h1>Bio</h1>
  <p>My name is Sonia Rivas. I am majoring in Communications with a minor in Information Management Technology at Illinois Tech. 
  I am interested in learning how to build websites. Other academic interests of mine include philosophy and english. I currently work full time and
  I'm attending school part time so that I can finally earn my degree. I transferred in from Morton College in Cicero, IL, so I'm a third year student.
  I hope to enjoy this class!</p>
